# EDennis.ExploringHttpLogging
This project demonstrates conditional logging of HTTP Requests, including request body and response body.  Whether requests are logged depends upon settings in a separate configuration file and how the middleware is called from within Startup.Configure.  In the configuration file, you specify whether the middleware is enabled, the maximum lengths for request and response bodies, whether to include headers and claims in the logs, which claim types/values can trigger the logging and what query key can trigger the logging.  In the Startup.Configure, you can use the standard app.UseWhen or one of the provided extension methods -- UseHttpLoggingWhen or UseHttpLoggingFor -- to perform the logging only under certain circumstances (e.g., particular endpoints).
